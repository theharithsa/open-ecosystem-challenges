- A commissioned vessel is fully delivered: its code and deployment repositories exist, its delivery workflow has completed, its Argo CD Application is synced, and its service is running in the cluster
- See the vessel's live deployment status on its page in Backstage
- The vessel's service is reachable directly and reports itself seaworthy"
