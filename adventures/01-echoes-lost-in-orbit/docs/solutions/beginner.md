# 🟢 Beginner Solution: Broken Echoes

Congratulations on taking on the first Open Ecosystem Challenge! In this walkthrough, we'll approach the challenge exactly as you would: start with the objectives, break them down one by one, and systematically fix what's broken. 🚀

> ⚠️ **Spoiler Alert:** This walkthrough contains the full solution to the challenge. We encourage you to try solving it on your own first. Consider coming back here only if you get stuck or want to check your approach.

## 📋 Step 1: Review the Challenge Objectives

Let's start by reading what we need to achieve. The challenge states:

> By the end of this level, you should:
>
> - See **two distinct Applications** in the Argo CD dashboard (one per environment)
> - Ensure each Application deploys to its **own isolated namespace**
> - **Make the system resilient** so Argo CD automatically reverts manual changes made to the cluster
> - Confirm that **updates happen automatically** without leaving stale resources behind

Perfect! Now we have four clear objectives to work toward. Let's tackle them one by one.

## 🔍 Step 2: Understand the Setup

Before we start fixing things, let's understand what we're working with. The challenge uses:

- **[Argo CD ApplicationSet](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/)**: Automatically generates Applications for multiple environments
- **[Git directory generator](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/Generators-Git/#git-generator-directories)**: Scans for directories in the `overlays/` folder (finds `staging` and `prod`)
- **[Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/)**: Manages environment-specific configurations
    - **Base**: Common configuration (deployment, service)
    - **Overlays**: Environment-specific customizations (staging and prod)

The file we need to fix is:

```bash
adventures/01-echoes-lost-in-orbit/beginner/manifests/appset.yaml
```

Let's open it:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
metadata:
  name: echo-server
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  generators:
    - git:
        repoURL: __REPO_URL__
        revision: HEAD
        directories:
          - path: adventures/01-echoes-lost-in-orbit/beginner/manifests/overlays/*
  template:
    metadata:
      name: echo-server
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: argocd
    spec:
      project: default
      source:
        repoURL: __REPO_URL__
        targetRevision: HEAD
        path: adventures/01-echoes-lost-in-orbit/beginner/manifests/overlays/{{path.basename}}
      destination:
        server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
        namespace: echo
      syncPolicy:
        syncOptions:
          - CreateNamespace=true
```

Now let's work through each objective.

## 🎯 Step 3: Clear Objectives

### Objective 1: See Two Distinct Applications in the Argo CD Dashboard

When opening the Argo CD dashboard (port `30100`), we won’t see any applications.

![Argo CD Dashboard - No Applications](./images/beginner/no-apps.png)

Let's check if the ApplicationSet is present:

```bash
kubectl get applicationset -n argocd
```

You should see `echo-server` listed. That means Argo CD is at least aware of our ApplicationSet.

Let's dig deeper and check the status of the ApplicationSet:

```bash
kubectl get applicationset echo-server -n argocd -o yaml
```

Scroll down to the `status.conditions` section. You should see an error like:

```yaml
- message: 'ApplicationSet echo-server contains applications with duplicate name: echo-server'
  reason: ErrorOccurred
  status: "False"
```

This error means there are duplicate application names. Let's look at how the name is set in the template.

The manifest shows:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: echo-server
  namespace: argocd
```

For each environment (staging and prod), Argo CD tries to create an application called `echo-server`. This fails because Kubernetes resources must have unique names in a namespace, but the ApplicationSet template uses a static name for every generated Application. The [Git directory generator](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/Generators-Git/#git-generator-directories) creates one Application per overlay directory, so you need a unique name for each.

#### How to fix?

Let's update the name field to use a template variable:

```yaml
name: echo-server-{{path.basename}}
```

This way, Argo CD will generate `echo-server-staging` and `echo-server-prod`. One for each environment. The `{{path.basename}}` variable is replaced with the directory name (e.g., `staging` or `prod`) for each overlay, ensuring uniqueness.

Now, let's apply the fix:

```bash
kubectl apply -n argocd -f adventures/01-echoes-lost-in-orbit/beginner/manifests/appset.yaml
```

Go back to the dashboard. You should now see two progressing applications.

#### Key Takeaways

- ApplicationSets use templates to generate multiple Applications, and names must be unique per environment.
- The Git directory generator creates one Application per overlay directory, so template variables like `{{path.basename}}` are essential for dynamic naming.
- The ApplicationSet and Application status are helpful for troubleshooting errors.

- [Git Directory Generator](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/Generators-Git/#git-generator-directories)

### Objective 2: Ensure each Application deploys to its own isolated namespace

We now have two applications showing up in Argo CD. But they are both deploying to the same namespace: `echo`.

Each environment should at least have its own namespace for isolation and to avoid resource conflicts. This can be achieved by using a template variable in the namespace field, just like with the application name.

#### How to fix?

Update the namespace field in the ApplicationSet manifest to include the `{{path.basename}}` variable:

```yaml
spec.template.spec.destination.namespace: echo-{{path.basename}}
```

Now, let's apply the fix:

```bash
kubectl apply -n argocd -f adventures/01-echoes-lost-in-orbit/beginner/manifests/appset.yaml
```

This will set the destination namespace to `echo-staging` and `echo-prod` for the respective environments.

### Objective 3: Make the system resilient so Argo CD automatically reverts manual changes made to the cluster

Our Applications are now deploying to separate namespaces, but they are not syncing yet and users can still make manual changes to the cluster. Let's split this objective into two clear steps:

#### Fix 1: Enable auto sync

By default, Argo CD does not automatically sync Applications. This means changes in Git are not applied to the cluster unless you manually trigger a sync (which is disabled for this challenge). To fix this, let's enable auto sync in the ApplicationSet manifest:

```yaml
syncPolicy:
  automated:
    enabled: true
  syncOptions:
    - CreateNamespace=true
```

Apply the change:

```bash
kubectl apply -n argocd -f adventures/01-echoes-lost-in-orbit/beginner/manifests/appset.yaml
```

Now, Argo CD will automatically sync the Applications whenever there are changes in Git.

> 💡 By default, this takes up to 3 minutes to detect changes. can speed this up by configuring a webhook to ArgoCD but for this challenge manually refreshing is just fine.

#### Fix 2: Enable self-healing (automatic reverts)

Auto sync alone will not revert manual changes made directly in the cluster. To make Argo CD truly resilient, let's enable self-healing. This will ensure that any drift from the desired state in Git is automatically corrected.

Update the ApplicationSet manifest to add `selfHeal: true`:

```yaml
syncPolicy:
  automated:
    enabled: true
    selfHeal: true
  syncOptions:
    - CreateNamespace=true
```

Apply the change:

```bash
kubectl apply -n argocd -f adventures/01-echoes-lost-in-orbit/beginner/manifests/appset.yaml
```

Let's test self-healing by making a manual change:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment echo-server-staging -n echo-staging --replicas=3
kubectl get pods -n echo-staging -w
```

Within seconds, Argo CD will detect the drift and scale it back down to 1 replica (as defined in Git).

#### Key Takeaways

- Auto sync ensures that changes in Git are automatically applied to the cluster.
- Self-healing ensures the cluster matches the desired state in Git, even after manual changes.
- Auto sync and self-heal together enforce GitOps and keep your cluster consistent.

- [Self-Healing in Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/auto_sync/#automatic-self-healing)

### Objective 4: Confirm that updates happen automatically without leaving stale resources behind

Now that our applications can sync automatically and self-heal, let's make sure that deleting resources from Git also removes them from the cluster. Otherwise, we risk leaving behind stale resources that are no longer needed.

By default, Argo CD does not remove resources from the cluster when they are deleted from Git. Pruning must be explicitly enabled to keep the cluster clean and in sync with Git.

#### How to fix?

Let's enable pruning by adding `prune: true` to the automated sync policy in the ApplicationSet manifest:

```yaml
syncPolicy:
  automated:
    enabled: true
    selfHeal: true
    prune: true
  syncOptions:
    - CreateNamespace=true
```

Apply the change:

```bash
kubectl apply -n argocd -f adventures/01-echoes-lost-in-orbit/beginner/manifests/appset.yaml
```

Now, Argo CD will automatically delete resources from the cluster when they're removed from Git.

#### Key Takeaways

- Pruning (in combination with self-heal) ensures the cluster matches Git exactly.
- Automated sync policies with pruning keep environments clean and up to date.

## ✅ Complete Solution

Here's what your corrected ApplicationSet should look like with all fixes applied:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
metadata:
  name: echo-server
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  generators:
    - git:
        repoURL: __REPO_URL__
        revision: HEAD
        directories:
          - path: adventures/01-echoes-lost-in-orbit/beginner/manifests/overlays/*
  template:
    metadata:
      name: echo-server-{{path.basename}}  # ✅ Unique name per environment
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: argocd
    spec:
      project: default
      source:
        repoURL: __REPO_URL__
        targetRevision: HEAD
        path: adventures/01-echoes-lost-in-orbit/beginner/manifests/overlays/{{path.basename}}
      destination:
        server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
        namespace: echo-{{path.basename}}  # ✅ Environment-specific namespace
      syncPolicy:
        automated: 
          enabled: true     # ✅ Automatic sync enabled
          selfHeal: true    # ✅ Reverts manual changes
          prune: true       # ✅ Deletes removed resources
        syncOptions:
          - CreateNamespace=true
```

That's it! Your ApplicationSet is now ready for resilient, automated, and clean multi-environment deployments with Argo CD.
