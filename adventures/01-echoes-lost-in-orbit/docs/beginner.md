# 🟢 Beginner: Broken Echoes

The Echo Server is misbehaving. Both environments seem to be down, and messages are silent. Your mission: investigate
the ArgoCD configuration and restore proper multi-environment delivery.

## ⏰ Deadline

## 📝 Solution Walkthrough

> ⚠️ **Spoiler Alert:** The following walkthrough contains the full solution to the challenge. We encourage you to try solving it on your own first. Consider coming back here only if you get stuck or want to check your approach.

Need help restoring multi-environment delivery? Follow the [step-by-step beginner solution walkthrough](./solutions/beginner.md) to learn how to:

- Investigate the Argo CD ApplicationSet and spot common pitfalls
- Adjust the Argo CD ApplicationSet to meet the challenge objective
- Understand the reasoning behind each change, not just the commands

The guide is written to explain not just what to do, but why. Dive in and level up your GitOps skills!

## 🎯 Objective

By the end of this level, you should:

- See **two distinct Applications** in the Argo CD dashboard (one per environment)
- Ensure each Application deploys to its **own isolated namespace**
- **Make the system resilient** so Argo CD automatically reverts manual changes made to the cluster
- Confirm that **updates happen automatically** without leaving stale resources behind

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- How Argo CD ApplicationSets work
- How to reason about templating and sync policies
- How drift detection and self-healing operate in GitOps workflows

## 🧰 Toolbox

Your Codespace comes pre-configured with the following tools to help you solve the challenge:

- [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/): The Kubernetes command-line tool for interacting with
  the cluster
- [`kubens`](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx): Fast way to switch between Kubernetes namespaces
- [`k9s`](https://k9scli.io/): A terminal-based UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters

## ✅ How to Play

### 1. Fork the Repository

- Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the GitHub repo or
  use [this link](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/open-ecosystem-challenges/fork).

### 2. Start a Codespace

- From your fork, click the green **Code** button → **Codespaces hamburger menu** → **New with options**.
  ![Create a new Codespace](./images/new-codespace.png)
- Select the **Adventure 01 | 🟢 Beginner (Broken Echoes)** configuration.
  ![Codespace options](./images/codespace-options.png)

> ⚠️ **Important:** The challenge will not work if you choose another configuration (or the default).

### 3. Wait for Infrastructure to Deploy

- Your Codespace will automatically provision a Kubernetes cluster, Argo CD, and the sample app. This usually takes
  around 5 minutes.

> 💡 **Tip:** To check the progress press `Cmd + Shift + P` (or `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows/Linux) and search for
`View Creation Log` (available after a few moments once the Codespace has initialized).

### 4. Access the Argo CD Dashboard

- Open the **Ports** tab in the bottom panel
- Find the Argo CD row (port `30100`) and click the forwarded address

  ![Ports](./images/ports-beginner.png)

- Log in using:
  ```
  Username: readonly
  Password: a-super-secure-password
  ```

### 5. Fix the Configuration

- All errors are located in this ApplicationSet:
  ```
  adventures/01-echoes-lost-in-orbit/beginner/manifests/appset.yaml
  ```
- Learn more about [ApplicationSets](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/) and
  the [Application Specification](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/application-specification/) in
  the [ArgoCD docs](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/application-specification/).

> 📦 **About Kustomize:** This challenge uses [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) under the hood to manage Kubernetes
> manifests. Kustomize allows us to maintain a **base** set of manifests (deployment, service) and apply
> environment-specific customizations through **overlays** (staging, prod). Each overlay can modify the base
> configuration—like changing replica counts or namespaces—without duplicating YAML. Argo CD automatically detects and
> applies these Kustomize configurations, so you don't need to run Kustomize commands manually. Your focus is on fixing
> the ApplicationSet to properly reference these Kustomize-managed paths.

- After making changes, apply them:
  ```
  kubectl apply -n argocd -f adventures/01-echoes-lost-in-orbit/beginner/manifests/appset.yaml
  ```
  (Run from the repo root)

### 6. Verify Your Solution

Once you think you've solved the challenge, it's time to verify!

#### Run the Smoke Test

Run the provided smoke test script from the repo root:

```bash
adventures/01-echoes-lost-in-orbit/beginner/smoke-test.sh
```

If the test passes, your solution is very likely correct! 🎉

#### Complete Full Verification

For comprehensive validation and to officially claim completion:

1. **Commit and push your changes** to your fork
2. **Manually trigger the verification workflow** on GitHub Actions
3. **Share your success** with
   the [community](https://community.open-ecosystem.com/t/adventure-01-echoes-lost-in-orbit-easy-broken-echoes/117)
