✨ Level 2 - 🟡 Intermediate (Outcome by cohort)

📂 Challenge directory:
   $CHALLENGE_DIR

🧪 Sibling services already running (managed by devcontainer compose):
   - flagd  → reachable inside the compose network as flagd:8013 (gRPC).
              No host-side forwarding — the lab calls it container-to-container.

▶  Run the lab — three named launch configs ship in .vscode/launch.json:
     🇩🇪  Run the Lab — Germany (COUNTRY=de)
     🇦🇹  Run the Lab — Austria (COUNTRY=at)
     🌍  Run the Lab — No country
   Open the Run and Debug view (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + D) and pick one.

   Or from the terminal:
     ./run-germany.sh   # COUNTRY=de + tee app.log
     ./run-austria.sh   # COUNTRY=at + tee app.log

👉 In another terminal, exercise the cohorts:
     curl 'http://localhost:8080/?species=zyklop'   # per-subject targeting
     curl 'http://localhost:8080/'               # falls through to country branch

✅ Run the verification when you're ready:
     ./verify.sh
   or use the 🧪 Verify Solution task: Tasks → Run Test Task.
